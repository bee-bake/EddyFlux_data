### Make EML for Eddy Flux data
### From: 4 April 2020 to 5 April 2021
### UPDATE WITH ALL 2021 DATA IN JANUARY!
### Following: MakeEMLInflow.R and MakeEMLChemistry.R
### 4 October 2021, A. Hounshell


# (install and) Load EMLassemblyline #####
# install.packages('devtools')

# devtools::install_github("EDIorg/EDIutils")
# devtools::install_github("EDIorg/taxonomyCleanr")
# devtools::install_github("EDIorg/EMLassemblyline")

#note that EMLassemblyline has an absurd number of dependencies and you
#may exceed your API rate limit; if this happens, you will have to wait an
#hour and try again or get a personal authentification token (?? I think)
#for github which allows you to submit more than 60 API requests in an hour
library(EMLassemblyline)


#Step 1: Create a directory for your dataset
#in this case, our directory is EddyFlux/EDI

#Step 2: Move your dataset to the directory
# Current dataset: 20211008_EddyPro_Cleaned.csv
# Update with all 2021 data in January!

#Step 3: Identify an intellectual rights license
#ours is CCBY

#Step 4: Identify the types of data in your dataset
#right now the only supported option is "table"; happily, this is what 
#we have!

#Step 5: Import the core metadata templates

#for our application, we will need to generate all types of metadata
#files except for taxonomic coverage, as we have both continuous and
#categorical variables and want to report our geographic location

# View documentation for these functions
?template_core_metadata
?template_table_attributes
?template_categorical_variables #don't run this till later
?template_geographic_coverage

# Import templates for our dataset licensed under CCBY, with 1 table.
template_core_metadata(path = "C:/Users/ahoun/Desktop/EddyFlux/EDI",
                       license = "CCBY",
                       file.type = ".txt",
                       write.file = TRUE)

template_table_attributes(path = "C:/Users/ahoun/Desktop/EddyFlux/EDI",
                          data.path = "C:/Users/ahoun/Desktop/EddyFlux/EDI",
                          data.table = c("20211008_EddyPro_Cleaned.csv"),
                          write.file = TRUE)


#we want empty to be true for this because we don't include lat/long
#as columns within our dataset but would like to provide them
template_geographic_coverage(path = "C:/Users/ahoun/Desktop/EddyFlux/EDI",
                             data.path = "C:/Users/ahoun/Desktop/EddyFlux/EDI",
                             data.table = c("20211008_EddyPro_Cleaned.csv"),
                             empty = TRUE,
                             write.file = TRUE)

#Step 6: Script your workflow
#that's what this is, silly!

#Step 7: Abstract
#copy-paste the abstract from your Microsoft Word document into abstract.txt
#if you want to check your abstract for non-allowed characters, go to:
#https://pteo.paranoiaworks.mobi/diacriticsremover/
#paste text and click remove diacritics

#Step 8: Methods
#copy-paste the methods from your Microsoft Word document into methods.txt
#if you want to check your methods for non-allowed characters, go to:
#https://pteo.paranoiaworks.mobi/diacriticsremover/
#paste text and click remove diacritics

#Step 9: Additional information
# Include authorship statement in the additional information

#Step 10: Keywords
#DO NOT EDIT KEYWORDS FILE USING A TEXT EDITOR!! USE EXCEL!!
#not sure if this is still true...let's find out! :-)
#see the LabKeywords.txt file for keywords that are mandatory for all Carey Lab data products

#Step 11: Personnel
#copy-paste this information in from your metadata document
#Cayelan needs to be listed several times; she has to be listed separately for her roles as
#PI, creator, and contact, and also separately for each separate funding source (!!)

#Step 12: Attributes
#grab attribute names and definitions from your metadata word document
#for units....
# View and search the standard units dictionary
view_unit_dictionary()
#put flag codes and site codes in the definitions cell
#force reservoir to categorical

#Step 14: Categorical variables
# Run this function for your dataset
#THIS WILL ONLY WORK once you have filled out the attributes_chemistry.txt and
#identified which variables are categorical
template_categorical_variables(path = "C:/Users/ahoun/Desktop/EddyFlux/EDI",
                               data.path = "C:/Users/ahoun/Desktop/EddyFlux/EDI",
                               write.file = TRUE)

#Step 15: Geographic coverage
#copy-paste the bounding_boxes.txt file (or geographic_coverage.txt file) that is Carey Lab specific into your working directory

#Step 16: Custom units
# Copy and paste custom units .txt file from prior year

## Step 17: Obtain a package.id FROM STAGING ENVIRONMENT. ####
# Go to the EDI staging environment (https://portal-s.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp),
# then login using one of the Carey Lab usernames and passwords. 

# Select Tools --> Data Package Identifier Reservations and click 
# "Reserve Next Available Identifier"
# A new value will appear in the "Current data package identifier reservations" 
# table (e.g., edi.123)
# Make note of this value, as it will be your package.id below

## Step XXX: Make EML metadata file using the EMLassemblyline::make_eml() command ####
# For modules that contain only zip folders, modify and run the following 
# ** double-check that all files are closed before running this command! **

## Make EML for staging environment
## NOTE: Will need to check geographic coordinates!!!
make_eml(
  path = "C:/Users/ahoun/Desktop/EddyFlux/EDI",
  data.path = "C:/Users/ahoun/Desktop/EddyFlux/EDI",
  eml.path = "C:/Users/ahoun/Desktop/EddyFlux/EDI",
  dataset.title = "Time series of carbon dioxide and methane fluxes measured with eddy covariance for Falling Creek Reservoir in southwestern Virginia, USA during 2020-2022",
  temporal.coverage = c("2020-04-04", "2022-05-02"),
  maintenance.description = 'ongoing',
  data.table = c("Apr2020toMay2022_EddyPro_Cleaned.csv"),
  data.table.description = c("EC Data"),
  data.table.name = "EC Data",
  other.entity= c("EddyPro_CleanUp.R","FCR_Process_BD.R","despike.R"),
  other.entity.description = c("R script to clean-up Eddy Pro output","R script for post-processing of EC data","Depsike function for post-processing"),
  other.entity.name = c("EddyPro CleanUp","EC Post-processing","Despike function"),
  user.id = 'ccarey',
  user.domain = 'EDI',
  package.id = 'edi.920.2')

## Step 8: Check your data product! ####
# Return to the EDI staging environment (https://portal-s.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp),
# then login using one of the Carey Lab usernames and passwords. 

# Select Tools --> Evaluate/Upload Data Packages, then under "EML Metadata File", 
# choose your metadata (.xml) file (e.g., edi.270.1.xml), check "I want to 
# manually upload the data by selecting files on my local system", then click Upload.

# Now, Choose File for each file within the data package (e.g., each zip folder), 
# then click Upload. Files will upload and your EML metadata will be checked 
# for errors. If there are no errors, your data product is now published! 
# If there were errors, click the link to see what they were, then fix errors 
# in the xml file. 

# Note that each revision results in the xml file increasing one value 
# (e.g., edi.270.1, edi.270.2, etc). Re-upload your fixed files to complete the 
# evaluation check again, until you receive a message with no errors.

## Step 17: Obtain a package.id. ####
# ED Data Package.id (originally reserved on 2 Feb 2022):
## NOTE: Will need to check geographic coordinates!!!
make_eml(
  path = "C:/Users/ahoun/Desktop/EddyFlux/EDI",
  data.path = "C:/Users/ahoun/Desktop/EddyFlux/EDI",
  eml.path = "C:/Users/ahoun/Desktop/EddyFlux/EDI",
  dataset.title = "Time series of carbon dioxide and methane fluxes measured with eddy covariance for Falling Creek Reservoir in southwestern Virginia, USA during 2020-2022",
  temporal.coverage = c("2020-04-04", "2022-01-11"),
  maintenance.description = 'ongoing',
  data.table = c("2020to2021_EddyPro_Cleaned.csv"),
  data.table.description = c("EC Data"),
  data.table.name = "EC Data",
  other.entity= c("EddyPro_CleanUp.R","FCR_Process_BD.R","despike.R"),
  other.entity.description = c("R script to clean-up Eddy Pro output","R script for post-processing of EC data","Depsike function for post-processing"),
  other.entity.name = c("EddyPro CleanUp","EC Post-processing","Despike function"),
  user.id = 'ccarey',
  user.domain = 'EDI',
  package.id = 'edi.1061.1')

## Step 18: Upload revision to EDI
# Go to EDI website: https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp and login with Carey Lab ID
# Click: Tools then Evaluate/Upload Data Packages
# Under EML Metadata File, select 'Choose File'
# Select the .xml file of the last revision (i.e., edi.202.4)
# Under Data Upload Options, select 'I want to manually upload the data by selecting...'
# Click 'Upload'
# Select text files and R file associated with the upload
# Then click 'Upload': if everything works, there will be no errors and the dataset will be uploaded!
# Check to make sure everything looks okay on EDI Website
